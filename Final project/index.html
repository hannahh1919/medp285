                you want to capture the moment and the feeling of the moment.  In this page you 
                will find some of my work and some of my favorite photos.  I hope you enjoy the

            <p>Photography is an art form that allows us to capture and preserve moments in time.
                 It can evoke emotions, tell stories, and showcase the beauty of the world around 
                 us. Whether it's a stunning landscape, a candid portrait, or a vibrant street 
                 scene, photography has the power to connect us with our surroundings.</p>
            <p>As a photographer, I strive to capture the essence of each moment, using light,
                 composition, and perspective to create images that resonate with viewers. My 
                 goal is to share my passion for photography and inspire others to see the world through a different lens.</p>
