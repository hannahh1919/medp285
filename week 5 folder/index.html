                <p>robotics have revolutionized our lives, making many things easier, like lifting things
                    up and moig them, like hydrilics in forlifts, and in hydrolic arms theres different types like 
                    water, steam. robotics have helped the medical world and made the impossible possible(though there 
                    is still some things that are impossible). all of this is possible because of great people in our history.

                    <p>robotics enginering (and man more forms of enginering) have chanegd our lives in many ways 
                        many people like marie cuire, nikola tesla, Charles Babbage, newton, and many more. and personally
                        i may be biased but  nikola tesla is one of the greatest minds when it comes to eletrical
                        enginering and robotics and alot of what we have today is because of him .</p>
