            <p>Forest green is a color that is a representation of the color of the trees, the forest. The first recorded use of forest green as a color name in English was in 1810. Forest green refers to a green color said to resemble the color of the trees and other plants in a forest. The word "forest" was introduced into the English language by the Norman rulers of England in the 11th century to denote an uncultivated area legally set aside for hunting by feudal nobility. These hunting forests were not necessarily wooded much, if at all. However, as hunting forests did often include considerable areas of woodland, the word "forest" eventually came to mean wooded land more generally.</p>
